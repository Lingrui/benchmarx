Road object categories:
```
[
    "bike",
    "bus",
    "car",
    "motor",
    "person",
    "rider",
    "traffic light",
    "traffic sign",
    "train",
    "truck"
]
```
They are labeld by `box2d`.

Drivable area categories:
```
[
    "area/alternative",
    "area/drivable"
]
```

Lane marking categories:
```
[
    "lane/crosswalk",
    "lane/double other",
    "lane/double white",
    "lane/double yellow",
    "lane/road curb",
    "lane/single other",
    "lane/single white",
    "lane/single yellow"
]
```

Both drivable areas and lane markings are labeled by `poly2d`. Please check the visulization code [`show_labels.py`](../bdd_data/show_labels.py) for examples of drawing all the labels.
